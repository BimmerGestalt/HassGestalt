            Most BMWs and Minis from around 2015-2021 implement a protocol that enables a feature named BMW Apps:
            Selected phone apps can temporarily add themselves to the car and show a car-specific interface for safe interaction.
            This is most commonly used to control the phone's music apps, but the protocol is much more powerful,
            and <a href="https://github.com/BimmerGestalt/AAIdrive">AAIdrive</a> has unofficially implemented most of Android Auto's functionality through this protocol.

            There used to be an official Samsung Smartthings app for the car, providing quick safe access to a subset of home automation through the car's dashboard.
            Though that app is dead, <a href="https://github.com/BimmerGestalt/HassGestalt">Hass Gestalt</a> reimplements this home automation control by connecting to Home Assistant.
